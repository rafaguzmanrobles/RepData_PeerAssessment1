## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loading}
##load data by using read.csv
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

##convert date into Date format
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r steps, ECHO=TRUE}
##1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(x = data$steps , by = list(data$date), FUN = sum ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(stepsPerDay) <- c("date", "steps")

##2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist <- qplot(stepsPerDay$steps, 
      geom="histogram",
      main= "Steps per day",
      xlab="Steps",
      ylab="Count")


```      
![Sample panel plot](instructions_fig/hist1.png) 
```{r mean, ECHO=TRUE}
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(stepsPerDay$steps , na.rm = TRUE)
```
[1] 9354.23


```{r median, ECHO=TRUE}
median(stepsPerDay$steps , na.rm = TRUE)
```
[1] 10395


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r dailyactivity, ECHO=TRUE}
##Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

avgStepsPerDay <- aggregate(x = data$steps , by = list(data$interval), FUN = mean ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(avgStepsPerDay) <- c("interval", "steps")


ggplot(avgStepsPerDay,aes(interval,steps)) +
        ggtitle("Time series plot of 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken") +
        geom_line()

```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
