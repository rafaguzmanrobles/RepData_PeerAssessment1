## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loading}
##load data by using read.csv
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

##convert date into Date format
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r steps, ECHO=TRUE}
##1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(x = data$steps , by = list(data$date), FUN = sum ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(stepsPerDay) <- c("date", "steps")

##2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist <- qplot(stepsPerDay$steps, 
      geom="histogram",
      main= "Steps per day",
      xlab="Steps",
      ylab="Count")


```
